## Introduction

This guide serves as a comprehensive resource designed to empower researchers, scientists, and practitioners with the knowledge and tools needed to execute science scalably within industry settings, with a particular focus on how to embrace [open science](https://www.cos.io/open-science) practices effectively. The contents aim to address the growing demand for transparent, reproducible, and collaborative research approaches in various domains.

Throughout, you will explore the ways in which industry is empowered by:

1. **Promoting open science culture:** The guide seeks to emphasize a culture of openness, transparency, and collaboration within the scientific community. It provides insights into the principles and benefits of open science, encouraging participants to adopt open methodologies and share their research outputs openly.

2. **Capacity building:** Through a combination of tutorials, example scenarios, and interactive activities, the guide equips participants with essential skills and techniques for working openly. It covers topics such as data management, code development, reproducibility, documentation, and collaborative workflows, enabling participants to implement open science practices effectively in their research projects.

3. **Navigating new tools and platforms:** The guide introduces participants to a wide range of open science tools, platforms, and resources that facilitate collaborative research and knowledge sharing, with an effort to also provide guidance on their selection and use.

4. **Encouraging Community Engagement:** By highlighting the importance of community engagement and participation in open science initiatives, the guide encourages participants to contribute to open-source projects, collaborate with peers, and engage with the broader scientific community. It emphasizes the value of sharing knowledge, expertise, and resources to drive collective innovation and impact.

5. **Facilitating Scalability and Sustainability:** As the title suggests, "Scaling Science" emphasizes scalability and sustainability in open science practices. The guide offers strategies and best practices for scaling open science initiatives within collaborative and often interdisciplinary industry settings, ensuring long-term impact and adoption.

"Scaling Science" was developed to empower researchers and practitioners with the knowledge, skills, and resources needed to embrace open science principles, foster collaboration, and drive positive change in their respective fields. By promoting openness, transparency, and community engagement, we hope this helps advance scientific research and accelerate progress towards solving many complex challenges in the geosciences.
